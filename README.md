What I think went well
-----

* All my tests pass and I managed to research spies and doubles and used them to keep my tests isolated.


What I found challenging
------

* I found getting my spies to work very challenging. Ultimately my testing has some limitations and is not fully isolated.
* The overall structure of the model was complex, but fun to workout

What I would do if I had more time
------
* Download lint and make my code beautiful


What I want to improve on
