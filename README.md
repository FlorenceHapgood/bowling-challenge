Bowling Challenge
=================

How to use
-----

* Clone this file
* Install Jasmine following these instructions https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine
* Run tests with Jasmine by typing open SpecRunner.html in the terminal
* Copy the full path of index.html into the browser to interact with the apply

Functionality 
-----
* It has the full functionality of a bowling score card according to the rules of bowling, apart from if you throw a strike in the 10th round. In that instance, it allows you to just keep playing forever...

Goals of feedback
-----
* I'd love some feedback on my use of spies and mocks.
* I'd love some feedback on my "private methods" (not really private yet in javascript, only using naming conventions) and if I tested them right.
* I know that I've left in some comments, but I think it will be helpful for me this week to look back at them.
* Any other feedback is of course very welcome.

What I think went well
-----

* All my tests pass. I managed to research spies and doubles and used them to keep my tests isolated.
* I'm really happy that almost all of the game works as it should according to the rules of bowling.
* My first time using jquery by myself was successful.


What I found challenging
------

* I found getting my spies to work very challenging. Ultimately my testing has some limitations and is not fully isolated.
* The overall structure of the model was complex, but fun to workout
* This was my first time using private methods (I didn't even do it in Ruby) and I'm not sure if I tested them right.

What I would do if I had more time
------
* Download lint and make my code beautiful


What I want to improve on
-----
* It took me a long time to research spies, with a lot of rabbit holes fallen into. I'm working on improving my research skills.
